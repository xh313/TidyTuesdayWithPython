# Tidy Tuesday with Python
My weekly (or monthly) data visualisation practicing using data from TidyTuesday, using Matplotlib and Python instead of R!

Data processing logic:
- Data on dog breeds and their different traits
- Quantifying all qualitative descriptions into scores using text processing
- Weighting and categorising each trait into two new parameters 'friendliness' and 'fluffiness'
- Plot scatter plot with each point corresponding to a breed on the quadrant of fluffiness-friendliness

Visual features:
- Detecting overlapping points or close-by points automatically and wrap/dodge off the labelling (still bugged :( )
- Generating a new colour for each data point on the tab 20b palette (or any other palettes, might change it if in the mood)
- Avenir typesetting! Avenir is the best
- Annotation of the breed name beside each data point
- Legend indexing all 190+ breed names

Issues:
- The overlap detector does not work for certain few points for some reason
- Graph too huge with too many data points -- hard to read! Don't know if there's a better way to present the data!
- Might need to adjust some weighings a bit (as I don't own a dog myself, I am biased!)

Plans:
- Indexing the position on the diagram for each breed and incorporating into the legend
- Improving the documentation and styling (it is currently unfortunately a mess!)
